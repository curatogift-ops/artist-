          <li><strong>Newsletter/Sign-Up Data:</strong> If you subscribe to our newsletter or marketing emails, we collect your email address.</li>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

          <li>To process and fulfill orders, including providing download links for digital PDFs.</li>
          <li>To manage your account and communicate with you (e.g., order confirmations, updates).</li>
          <li>To send marketing communications (only with your consent, where required; you can opt out at any time).</li>
          <li>To improve the Site, products, and services (e.g., analytics).</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR Compliance)</h2>
        <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or other regions with similar laws, our processing of your personal data is based on:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> To fulfill orders and provide digital downloads.</li>
          <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For marketing emails or non-essential cookies.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For Site security, analytics, and improvements (where it does not override your rights).</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> To comply with applicable laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Sharing Your Information</h2>

          <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, court order, or to protect our rights/safety.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, sale, or acquisition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For digital downloads, no physical shipping is involved, so we do not share address data with couriers.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures (e.g., encryption for payments) to protect your information. However, no online transmission is 100% secure. You use the Site at your own risk.</p>
